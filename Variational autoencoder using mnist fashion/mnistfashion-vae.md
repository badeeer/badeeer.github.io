# Variational Autoencoder for Fashion MNIST

## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook, "mnistfashion-vae.ipynb," is an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for the Fashion MNIST dataset. It serves as an introduction to VAEs and their application in generative modeling.
This notebook includes the following key components:

Introduction to VAE and Fashion MNIST
Inspired by the book "Deep Learning" by Fran√ßois Chollet
The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model used in machine learning and deep learning. It is particularly useful for tasks like data generation, image reconstruction, and feature learning. The Fashion MNIST dataset serves as a suitable candidate for applying VAE.

Fashion MNIST is a dataset comprising grayscale images of clothing and fashion items. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images across ten different classes, each representing a different fashion item such as shoes, dresses, or t-shirts. The dataset is widely used in machine learning for image classification tasks and, in this context, for VAE-based generative modeling.

The Problem: The problem addressed here is to leverage a Variational Autoencoder to learn a compact, continuous latent space representation of the Fashion MNIST images. VAEs are designed to capture the underlying structure in data and enable the generation of new, similar data samples from this learned latent space.

import tensorflow as tf: This imports the TensorFlow library, a popular open-source machine learning framework, and assigns it the alias tf.

from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist: This line imports the Fashion MNIST dataset from the TensorFlow Keras library. Fashion MNIST is a dataset of grayscale images of fashion items like clothing, shoes, and accessories.

from tensorflow.keras.models import Model: This line imports the Model class from TensorFlow Keras, which is used to define and train machine learning models.

from tensorflow.keras import layers: This imports various layers used to build neural networks, such as dense layers and convolutional layers, from the TensorFlow Keras library.

from tensorflow import keras: This imports the keras submodule from TensorFlow, which is a high-level neural networks API, making it easier to build and train models.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt: This line imports the matplotlib library and assigns the alias plt. Matplotlib is used for data visualization and plotting, which can be handy for visualizing model performance and data.

import numpy as np: This line imports the NumPy library and assigns it the alias np. NumPy is used for numerical operations and working with arrays, which is fundamental in machine learning for data manipulation.
