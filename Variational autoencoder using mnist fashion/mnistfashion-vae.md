# Variational Autoencoder for Fashion MNIST

## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook, "mnistfashion-vae.ipynb," is an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for the Fashion MNIST dataset. It serves as an introduction to VAEs and their application in generative modeling.

## Overview

- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: A VAE is a generative model used in machine learning and deep learning. It is particularly useful for tasks like data generation, image reconstruction, and feature learning. This notebook explores the architecture and implementation of a VAE.

- **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images of clothing and fashion items. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images across ten different classes, each representing a different fashion item such as shoes, dresses, or t-shirts.

## Key Components

This notebook includes the following key components:

- **Data Preprocessing**: The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including normalizing pixel values and adding a channel dimension for grayscale images.

- **Encoder Network**: The encoder network is defined, which maps input images to a latent space representation. It comprises convolutional layers and dense layers.

- **Sampler**: A custom layer, "Sampler," is used to sample points in the latent space based on the mean and log-variance of the latent space distribution.

- **Decoder Network**: The decoder network is defined, which maps points in the latent space back to reconstructed images. It comprises dense layers and transposed convolutional layers.
