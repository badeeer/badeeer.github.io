# Variational Autoencoder for Fashion MNIST

This project focuses on implementing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for the Fashion MNIST dataset, providing a detailed Jupyter notebook available [here](https://github.com/badeeer/mnistfashion-vae.git). The structured workflow encompasses the following steps:

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The notebook initiates by loading the Fashion MNIST dataset and performing necessary preprocessing steps, such as normalizing pixel values and structuring the data for training and testing. Refer to the code [here](https://github.com/badeeer/mnistfashion-vae.git#data-loading-and-preprocessing).

2. **VAE Architecture Definition**: The VAE architecture is defined, encompassing an encoder network, a custom "Sampler" layer for latent space sampling, and a decoder network. The architecture utilizes convolutional layers, dense layers, and transposed convolutional layers. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/badeeer/mnistfashion-vae.git#vae-architecture-definition).

3. **Training the VAE**: The VAE is trained using the Fashion MNIST dataset, with details on loss functions, optimizers, and training parameters. The training progress is monitored, and the model is saved for future use. The relevant code is available [here](https://github.com/badeeer/mnistfashion-vae.git#training-the-vae).

4. **Generating Samples**: The trained VAE is utilized to generate new samples by sampling from the learned latent space. The generated samples are visualized and provide insights into the model's generative capabilities. Refer to the code [here](https://github.com/badeeer/mnistfashion-vae.git#generating-samples).

5. **Conclusion and Usage**: The project concludes with insights into the VAE's performance, its generative capabilities, and potential use cases. Users are encouraged to refer to the detailed Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/badeeer/mnistfashion-vae.git) and the accompanying README [here](https://github.com/badeeer/mnistfashion-vae.git#readme) for a more in-depth understanding and implementation details.

The implementation draws inspiration from similar structured projects, such as the Ten Animals Image Classifier [here](https://github.com/badeeer/Ten-animales-classifier-/blob/master/ten-animals-classifier.ipynb).
